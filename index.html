	<h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>
	<h2 align="center">I'm Luis Estevez, a Computer Science student at SUNY Oswego</h2>
	
	<h2 align="left">About:</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em">I started attending SUNY Oswego in 2017, and plan on graduating in 2021.<br>
	I was born/raised in Brooklyn, New York and that is where I still reside.
	I am a major in Computer Science and a minor in Cognitive Science. I have
	experience programming in Java, Python, Scala, Clojure, C, Prolog, HTML, CSS, and Swift.
	This site is one of the first websites that I actually publish, so this can be seen as a good
	representation of my HTML/CSS skills!
	
	<br><br>Recently I published a notepad application onto the iOS app store. 
	This was a side project I started in order to learn Swift. 
	I liked the idea of having an app I wrote on the app store, so I did exactly that!
	Programming has been a passion of mine for some time, so I'm always looking for new
	challenges/opportunities to encounter!</p>
