	<h2 align="left">About:</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em">I started attending SUNY Oswego in 2017, and plan on graduating in 2021.<br>
	I was born/raised in Brooklyn, New York and that is where I still reside.
	I am a major in Computer Science and a minor in Cognitive Science. I have
	experience programming in Java, Python, Scala, Clojure, C, Prolog, HTML, and CSS. Recently I published
	a notepad application, my first application, onto the app store. This was
	a side project I started in order to learn Swift. I liked the idea of having an app
	I wrote on the app store, so I did exactly that!
	This is also one of the first websites that I work on, so this can be seen as
	an example of my HTML/CSS skills! I'm always looking for new
	challenges/opportunities to encounter</p>
